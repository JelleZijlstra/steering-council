- The SC welcomed Emily to the SC.
- The SC summarized how it works: meetings, note taking, task list,
  communication channels, public updates, PEP reviews, meeting with Łukasz
  (Developer-in-residence) and Deb (PSF Executive Director).
- The SC discussed improvements to the process, mainly how to get updates
  out faster.
- The SC reviewed its outstanding tasks. Decision-making is left for the new
  year.
- The SC discussed the backwards compatibility policy, trying to find ways
  to answer questions like "Does it need a PEP?", "Should it be backported?"
  consistently.
- The SC briefly discussed managing the scope of the standard library.
- The SC discussed how to work with (full-time) developers who work too fast
  for many reviewers to keep up with. (For a variety of reasons we expect

- The SC said good-bye to Petr.
