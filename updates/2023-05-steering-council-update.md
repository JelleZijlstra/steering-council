- The SC discussed with the Developer-in-Residence (Łukasz) the position of
  Deputy Developer-in-Residence, including a draft for the position and the
  involvement that Łukasz will have in the role.
- The SC discussed an [apparent semantic
  change](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-709-one-behavior-change-that-was-missed-in-the-pep/26691)
  with [PEP 709 (Inlined comprehensions)](https://peps.python.org/pep-0709/)
  involving comprehensions in class bodies. After deliberation, the SC
  agreed that we are ok with the general frame semantics of PEP 709 given
  the performance benefits but we are not ok with the semantic changes that
  go outside this even if they are more desirable. The SC will communicate
  this to the PEP authors.

  sprint including budget.
